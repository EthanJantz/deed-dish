		<h2 id="what-is-deed-dish-">What is Deed Dish?</h2>
		<p>Deed Dish is a database of documents describing the chain of title for properties in Chicago. The website provides a simple interface for exploring property ownership and getting the &quot;dish&quot; about a property&#39;s deeds.</p>
		<h2 id="how-do-i-use-deed-dish-">How Do I Use Deed Dish?</h2>
		<p>Use the mouse to explore and interact with the map. Clicking on a parcel (blue) will highlight that parcel and load the deed history for it on the <strong>Parcel Information</strong>
			panel. Each deed has an associated document number (in blue), date of execution, deed type, consideration amount, and list of grantees. If a grantee name is orange, clicking on it will highlight other parcels on the map where that name has shown up in the property&#39;s deed history. Clicking on a document number will bring you to a copy of the original document that the data was collected from.</p>
		<h2 id="why-deed-dish-">Why Deed Dish?</h2>
		<p>The idea behind Deed Dish started back in 2020, when I came across the <a href="https://www.cookcountyclerkil.gov/recordings/search-recordings">Cook County Recordings</a>
			website while doing research in graduate school. Other research I had been reading focused on using data from county assessors&#39; offices to explore property history and ownership. Deeds and other legal documents provide a rich collection of data for exploring a building&#39;s history, and so I built this tool as a proof of concept as part of my time at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>.</p>
		<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
		<p>Data for this project is scraped from the Cook County Recorder&#39;s <a href="https://crs.cookcountyclerkil.gov/Search">website</a>
			and Cook County&#39;s open data portal, <a href="https://hub-cookcountyil.opendata.arcgis.com/">Cook Central</a>.</p>
		<h2 id="why-isn-t-data-loading-for-my-parcel-">Why isn&#39;t data loading for my parcel?</h2>
		<p>The website may be experiencing a lot of traffic. If you try again in a minute you should have better luck.</p>
		<h2 id="about-the-developer">About the Developer</h2>
		<p>I&#39;m Ethan Jantz, a software engineer based out of Chicago. Learn more about me and my work at <a href="https://jantz.website">jantz.website</a>. If you want to talk to me about this project you can reach me <a href="mailto:info@deeddish.com">here</a>.</p>
		<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
		<p>Currently, Deed Dish only contains records for parcels in the Logan Square, Avondale, Humboldt Park, and West Town <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_areas_in_Chicago">community areas</a>.</p>
